Observations:
1. Fabric is a SINGLE node standalone machine. For fail over we can use the fabric.routing.servers=3.86.237.103:7687,54.152.16.195:7687. 
it doesnt mean they are acting as cluster.
2. queries are getting executed as below. 
    a. all READ are going to Followers as expected.
    b. all Write or Rollback happening on Leader.
3. It is mandatory to mention the database to the fabric database. Otherwise by default it takes "Neo4j" and 
queries will return errors Saying "Multiple database queries are possible only on fabric database"
