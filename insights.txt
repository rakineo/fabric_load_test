Observations:
1. Fabric is a SINGLE node standalone machine. For fail over we can use the fabric.routing.servers=3.86.237.103:7687,54.152.16.195:7687. 
it doesnt mean they are acting as cluster.




Test results:
1. All queries (Read, Write and Update) were going to the Leader node of that corresponding Database.
